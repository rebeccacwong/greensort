# greensort
Informational website for Greensort, a brand identity that I created for Design Innovation 21: Visual Communications and Sketching. Created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Website viewable [here](https://rebeccacwong.github.io/greensort/). 

## Technologies
* Bootstrap
* Lottie / Bodymovin

## Resources
A majority of the vectors in the interface and the website are from FreePik, but I did heavily modify a lot of them. I created all the animations in After Effects using base vectors from FreePik.
